Intern Screening Task – Hybrid Web + Desktop Application


You are required to build a hybrid application that runs both as a Web Application and a Desktop Application. The project focuses on data visualization and analytics for chemical equipment.
 Project Title:
Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer (Hybrid Web + Desktop App)
 Project Overview
 Create a Web + Desktop application that allows users to upload a CSV file containing a list of chemical equipment with columns such as Equipment Name, Type, Flowrate, Pressure, and Temperature. The Django backend will parse the data, perform analysis, and provide summary statistics via API. Both React (Web) and PyQt5 (Desktop) frontends will consume this API to display data tables, charts, and summaries.
 Tech Stack (Fixed)
Layer
	Technology
	Purpose
	Frontend (Web)
	React.js + Chart.js
	Show table + charts
	Frontend (Desktop)
	PyQt5 + Matplotlib
	Same visualization in desktop
	Backend
	Python Django + Django REST Framework
	Common backend API
	Data Handling
	Pandas
	Reading CSV & analytics
	Database
	SQLite
	Store last 5 uploaded datasets
	Version Control
	Git & GitHub
	Collaboration & submission
	Sample Data
	sample_equipment_data.csv
	Sample CSV file provided for testing & demo
	 Key Features Required
1.  CSV Upload – Web and Desktop must allow users to upload a CSV file to the backend.
2.  Data Summary API – Django API should return total count, averages, and equipment type distribution.
3. Visualization – Display charts using Chart.js (Web) and Matplotlib (Desktop).
4.  History Management – Store last 5 uploaded datasets with summary.
5. Generate PDF report and add basic authentication.
6. (Extra) Use the provided sample CSV (sample_equipment_data.csv) for demo and testing.
 Task Instructions 
Develop both Web and Desktop frontends connected to the same Django backend. The application should demonstrate proper data handling, API integration, and UI/UX consistency.
 Submission Guidelines
• Source code on GitHub (backend + both frontends)
• README file with setup instructions (should be made available with the Github Source Code)
• Short demo video (2–3 minutes)
• Optional: Deployment link for web version
